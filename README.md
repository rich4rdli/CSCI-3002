## Trashr App

Welcome to the Trashr application prototype, developed by Jeff Huynh, Richard Li, and Nick Mozdzier as our course project for CSCI-3002. Trashr is a mobile app designed to track an individual's waste habits through a scoring system that considers trash, recycling, electronic-recycling and composting routines. Items are scanned in before being thrown away or recycled, and a user will accumulate points based on several attributes of the object. Trashr also supports a gamified social aspect where users may compete with households in their surrounding neighborhood to see who is ultimately the most environmentall friendly.
